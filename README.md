# koobits_asessment

The python scripts and answers to the questions.

Requirement to run the local scripts:
- please run the requirement.txt in the virtual environment.
- AWS credentials are store in default local aws directory with '~/.aws/credentials'
- Note, question 10 requires docker to pull the aws glue image for local run.
- S3 bucket and redshift resource and their connection details


Data:
- A dataset called 'xAPI-Edu-Data.csv' is used to mock in question 1
- An external sample API was used to mock question 2 and 3

The questions are tailored to koobits educational context to my best understanding.

Thank you.
