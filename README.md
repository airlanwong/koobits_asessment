# koobits_asessment

The python scripts and answers to the questions.
please run the requirement.txt in the virtual environment.
Note, question 10 requires docker to pull the aws glue image for local run.

The questions are tailored to koobits educational context to my best understanding.

A dataset called 'xAPI-Edu-Data.csv' is used to mock in question 1
An external sample API was used to mock question 3

Thank you.
